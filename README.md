CDN STORAGE FOR OSSN 6.2 >=
============================
This component allow you to make users files to be uploaded on CDN if component supports it. We tried to make all core components works with CDN. 

Supported Storages :

- DigitalOcean Spaces
- Amazon S3

Please don't use it for your production sites until OSSN 6.2 released.  

**NOTE**

If you change your storage system there will be issue for deleting the existing files from system.  So decided at once about which one you would like you.  

**FURTHER**

 This component is a beta stage. May show unexpcted behaviour. So again dont use it for production yet.
